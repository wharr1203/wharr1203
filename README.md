## Projects 

### [Movie Analysis](https://github.com/austint1121/VenusMovieAnalysis)
The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights to the head of Microsoft's new fictional movie studio. We used data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. After analyzing the data the group decided to recommend a genre of movie to make, which month to release the movie in, and how long the movie should be.

### [Housing Price Analysis](https://github.com/ElyLin/HomePriceAnalysis)
The Purpose of this project was to construct a linear regression model that can accurately predict the prices of houses in King County, Washington based on the features of the houses. We also analyzed the impact that various housing features individually had on the price of a house. The business problem in this project is that a fictional bank needs a way to determine that if a house has enogh value to be used as collateral before giving out loans to a client, so we are giving the bank a predictive model to solve their problem.
