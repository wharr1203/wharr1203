## Projects 

### [Movie Analysis](https://github.com/austint1121/VenusMovieAnalysis)
The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights to the head of Microsoft's new fictional movie studio. We used data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. After analyzing the data the group decided to recommend a genre of movie to make, which month to release the movie in, and how long the movie should be.

### [Housing Price Analysis](https://github.com/ElyLin/HomePriceAnalysis)
The Purpose of this project was to construct a linear regression model that can accurately predict the prices of houses in King County, Washington based on the features of the houses. We also analyzed the impact that various housing features individually had on the price of a house. The business problem in this project is that a fictional bank needs a way to determine that if a house has enogh value to be used as collateral before giving out loans to a client, so we are giving the bank a predictive model to solve their problem.

### [Tanzanian Water Well Classification](https://github.com/djs6478/Well-Project)
The purpose of this project was to build a model that can successfully classify the functionality of water wells in Tanzania. The model uses the various charecteristics of wells to determine if they are either functional or non-functional. The business problem here is that an organization(Wells of Life) that is trying to alleviate the water crisis in Tanzania needs a way to determine which wells need immediate repair, so that they dont waste time inspecting wells that dont need . 

### [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/wharr1203/Chimera-Movie-Recommendations)
The aim of this project was to build a movie recommendation system using Python's surprise library that could accurately predict the rating that a subscriber would give a movie. The business problem here is that a new streaming service needs a recommendation system that will allow them to thrive in the highly saturated field of media streaming and we are providing them with the recommendation system that will give them the means to suceed.

### [Pet Adoption Speed Analysis](https://github.com/wharr1203/BloomingtonPetAdoption)
The objective of this project is to construct a model that can correctly classify the dogs and cats that have the hardest time getting adopted, so that the shelters can advertise those pets more and push potential adopters towards them. The business problem that this project solves is; ASPCA needs to know which types of pets need the most help getting adopted, so that they can use their resources to help change the stigma about certain pets and inform shelters which pets to advertise the most.
